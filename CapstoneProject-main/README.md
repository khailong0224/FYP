# CapstoneProject

Under this github folder there will be 2 different parts each for frontend and backend
I will try and complete the frontend code asap the frontend code as for now will only consist of basic features without content and words just the basics layout that is working fine

Tested environment :
1> Chrome
2> Android emulator pixel phone

Lib Folder is a frontend web ui folder
consists of -> 
1>Constant (Where all the fixed variables are being stored)
2>Pages (where all of smaller pages are stored)
3>Components (where all of the smaller components for ex: sidedrawer,appbar and etc are being stored)


Steps to download : 

0> Create own Flutter file on Device
1> Locate the flutter file location
2> Locate these files: 
                      1>lib
                      2>pubspec.yaml
                      3>assets (will not exist at ur native device, just download it and place it under the same Flutter file)
4> download everything and replace all the exisiting file with the files mentioned in (Step [2])
5> Check for Dependencies/package (import or remove existing package)
6> Check for the name (the current name is practice)

do let me know if there are any other errors
